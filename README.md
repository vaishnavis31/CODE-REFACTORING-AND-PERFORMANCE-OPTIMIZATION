### FACE RECOGNITION PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION
THIS PROJECT IMPLEMENTS FACE RECOGNITION USING OPEN-SOURCE LIBRARIES. IT INCLUDES FACE DETECTION, IMAGE PREPROCESSING, AND RECOGNITION FUNCTIONALITY. THE CODE HAS BEEN REFACTORED TO IMPROVE READABILITY, PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINABILITY.

## FEATURES
- **MODULAR STRUCTURE**: SEPARATE MODULES FOR DETECTION, PREPROCESSING, AND RECOGNITION.
- **OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE**: REDUCED EXECUTION TIME AND MEMORY USAGE.
- **LOGGING SUPPORT**: REPLACES PRINT STATEMENTS WITH LOGGING FOR BETTER DEBUGGING.
- **IMPROVED DOCUMENTATION**: DETAILED DOCSTRINGS AND A CLEAR README FILE.
